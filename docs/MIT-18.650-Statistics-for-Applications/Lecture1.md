# GOALS
> To give students a solid introduction to the mathematical theory behind statistical metods.
> To povide theoretical guarantees for the statistical methods that one may use for certain applications.
>At the end of this lecture one should e able to 
From a real life situation formulate a statistical problems in mathematical terms
Select appropriate statistical methods for one's problems
Understand the implacations and limitations of this methods

### Why statistics should be studied?
Data helps us in making decisions.
Statistics at use doesn't give us stateents about individuals. Not even the cohort of people the looked at they are statemnts about a parameter about a distribution, that was used to model the benefit of waiting (in the context of the research paper from Nature "studies show that students benefit by waiting for major")
### Why statistics is necessary?
What is randomness in data. In an experiment, as a rule of thumb, whatever it is that we don't necessarily understand or can't put the reason of is the randomness. for instance a complicated process, it can be thought of just a simple process having some random noise. 
We always try to tame this randomness in data to comprehend or predict the future result better, in other words try to reason whatever we don't necessarily understand the reason of in an experiment. 
THe associated questions of randomness is the 

- Notion of average ("fair premium....")
- Quantifying chance ("most of the floods...")
- significance, Variability

Probabilty is the study of this randomness, in probability, the basic number were given to us, we aimed to work on them. Statistics is abou tfinding out those ransom numbers. 
- If we be rolling one die
Alice gets $1 if # of dots =<3
Alice gets $2 if # of dots =<2
Who do one will want to be, Alice or Bob?
Only average will not be a sufficient tool to answer our question, we will be needing the long term average or the expected value (the weighted average)
